		Assorted observations of mine that don't merit an entire page devoted to them.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Under our current understanding of physics, the modern environment in which humans have kids fairly often and the population grows over time is a very weird and unsustainable state. The number of atoms under control of humans over time is O(t<sup>3</sup>), and any exponential function will eventually outpace that. No matter the wonders you imagine in a post-Singularity future, you'll still have to pick between inevitable death and the chance to have children more than once in a bilion years. (This makes me pretty sad.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Something like the Dunning-Kruger effect is actually exactly what you expect from well-calibrated individuals, if your measurement of skill is at all noisy. The people who score lowest on your test will have done so out of a combination of poor skill and poor luck, so their true skill will be higher than what you measured - it isn't surprising if their self-estimated skill is too! (One can isolate decidedly irrational behavior with more careful setups - I'm not claiming people are actually calibrated about this sort of thing - but "the worst performers at a task think themselves better at it" ought to be your default expectation and not a surprising result in and of itself.)
		</li>

		// this part gets the file name from the URL.
		var urlArray = window.location.href.split("/");

		var nameOfThisPage = urlArray[urlArray.length-1];

		// this part uses the github API to get the last commit data for that file, and then writes a line the HTML body.

		// future Eli, this is a function. It is in Arrow syntax. You should learn this.
		const getCommits = async pageName => {

			var result = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/drake-thomas/drake-thomas.github.io/commits?path='+ encodeURIComponent(pageName));

			var data = await result.json();

			var timestamp = new Date(data[0].commit.author.date)
			// the Date function takes a date string, and returns a date object.

			//var month = timestamp.getMonth()


			var formattedDate = timestamp.toDateString()

			console.log(formattedDate)




			document.getElementById('last-updated').innerHTML = "<p><br><i>This page was last updated on "+ formattedDate + ".</i></p>";
