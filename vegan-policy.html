		<h1>Veganism policy</h1>
	</div>


<div class="main text">
	<div>
    <p>I am vegan, with the following caveats.</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm currently conisering taking daily supplements of grass-fed beef offal.</li>
            <!--<li>I take daily fish oil supplements.</li>-->
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Factory Farming is incredibly and transparently evil, and I do not want to subsidize it or in any way perpetuate it. Eating industrially-produced meat seems to me to be
        about as straightforward an ethical failure as purchacing cotton produced by slaves in the the American Antebellum South (one of the most unethical
        manifestations of slavery ever practiced on planet earth). </p>

	<h3>Animal consciousness?</h3>

	<p>	I'm deeply ignorant about what consciousness is and the mechanism are necessary for it, and there is an anthropic argument (which I don't know how to think clearly about) that conscious experience is rare among non-human animals.
		But from my state of knowledge, it seems like a better than even chance that many mammals have some kind of "inner listener". And if they have an inner listener at all, pain seems like one of the simplest and most convergent experiences to have.</p>

	<p>Which makes industrial factory farming an unconscionable atrocity, much worse than American slavery. It is not okay to treat conscious beings like that, no matter how dumb they are, or how little they narrativize about themselves.</p>

	<p>There are currently about <a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/">100 billion individual animals</a> living in factory farms. Assuming that they are all conscious beings, that's 100 billion experience-years in factory farms every year.</p>

	<p>It seems to me that, in my state of uncertainty, it is extremely irresponsible to say "eh, whatever" to the possible moral atrocity. We should <a href="https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/">shut up and multiply</a>. My uncertainty about animal consciousness only reduces the expected number of experience-years of torture by a factor of 2 or so.</p>

<p>An expected 50 billion moral patients getting tortured as a matter of course is the worst moral catastrophe perpetrated by humans <i>ever</i> (with the possible exception of anthroprogenic existentail risk).</p>

<p>Even if someone has more philosophical clarity than I do, they have to be confident at at a level of around 100,000 to 1 that livestock animals are not experiencing beings, before the expected value of this moral catastrophe starts being comparable in scale to
	well-known moral catastrophes like the Holocaust, and American slavery, and the Mongol conquest. Anything less than that, and the expected value of industrial meat production is beating every other moral catastrophe by orders of magnitude (again, with the exception of anthroprogenic x-risk).</p>

<p>(Admittedly this analysis is making some assumptions about the moral value of pain and fear, relative to other good and bad things that can happen to a person, which might influence how we weight the experiences of non-human animals compared to humans. But "pain and terror are really bad, and it is
	really bad for someone to persistently experience pain and terror" seems like a not-very-crazy assumption. That the inner lives of non-human animals are less <i>complex</i> than my own suggests a decrease in moral badness of maybe two orders of magnitude, at best. And even that much is pretty sketchy.)</p>

<h3>What about happy animals?</h3>

    <p>What about raising animals to have happy lives in humane circumstances and killing them to eat? I'm uncretain on this point: it seems plausible
		to me that the equlibrium of my moral philosophy asigns a special value to personhood, such that creating conscious beings with the explicit intent of later
		ending their existence is sad, even if their lives are net positive, and even if they add to the agregate utility of the universe. It also seems plausible to
		me that positive conscious experience is a robust good or even that personal identity is ulitmately a confused concept that isn't loadbearing for anything in equilibrium
		ethics.

		<p>So I'm not sure what the moral sign of humanely raising animals for slaughter is. It seems plausible that it could be a positive or a negative. But regardless,
			the magnitude of this moral dilema is enromously smaller than that of industrial farming. I don't care about this question much, compared to the question of
			whether factory farms acceptable.</p>

		<!--<p>In our current world, eating only humanely raised animals seems to me like a realatively good choice. I recommend BLAH from BLAH </p>-->


	<h3>My personal trajectory</h3>
    <p>I've been vegetarian since I was 15, originally because I reasoned that I didn't care if something ate me after I died,
        but I did have a preference that I not be killed to be eaten, and thought that I should extend the same courtesy to other animals.
        (Also, I had read that Atlantean priests were vegetarians, which also influenced me.)
        I have an allergy to milk, so I was functionally ovo-vegetarian. Around 2018, I started adding a small amount of meat back into my diet out of nutritional
        concerns, and then in 2020, discovered that eggs are among the most suffering-intensive animal products, and so decided to stop eating any
		eggs and instead eat small amounts of beef on a regular basis. I became as fully vegan as I am now around 2021.</p>
