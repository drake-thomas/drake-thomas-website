	<p>Twitter is close to a write-only platform, for me.</p>

	<p>I use a <a href="https://roamjs.com/extensions/twitter">roam extension</a> that let's me write twitter threads from my roam, so that I can post things without needing to go to the site. (I have a dedicated roam database for this, because otherwise I would be concerned about accidentally posting my personal journal entries to twitter.)<br><br>I have twitter <a href="https://blocksite.co/desktop-lp/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=sch_dsk_bs_desktop_brnd_exct_us&adgroupid=126179912147&keyword=blocksite&device=c&gclid=CjwKCAiA9tyQBhAIEiwA6tdCrMPSU7Dpge_fuHspRq-4yv4jqc_kbRWN8oj9Zmo3JANXgHlsIpF2hRoC5DUQAvD_BwE">blocked</a> on my main machine. I have a separate chromebook that I use to browse twitter itself.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>Every once in a while (between once a week and once a month), I'll check twitter on on my twitter machine, mostly looking through and responding to my messages, and possibly looking at the pages of some of my favorite people on twitter.<br><br>All of this is to avoid the dopamine loops of twitter, which can suck up hours of my life like nothing else can.&nbsp;</p>

	<p>The character of my personal setup makes me think that maybe it is unethical for me to use twitter at all. Posting, but mostly not reading other people's content, in particular, seems like maybe a defection, and I don't want to incentivize people to be on the platform. (My guess is that twitter is only a little worse for me than for the median twitter user, though there are also twitter users for which it just straight up provides a ton of value).&nbsp;</p>

	<p>To counter this, I add all my threads to <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/user/EpistemicHope">threadreader</a>, so that people can read my content without needing to touch the attention-eating cesspool.</p>
