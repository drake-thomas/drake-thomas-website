	<h2>What I Want</h2>

	<p>I’m attempting to live with an <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1364023511983923202.html">open heart</a> and with scrupulous epistemic standards<!---epistemic scrupulosity / fastidiousness | epistemic integretty | epistemics or epistemic stanards?--><!-- Also, with integrity. Also, work hard -->. Above everything else, I want relationships, romantic or otherwise, that support and nourish me in that.

	<p>I'm open to two pretty different flavors of relationship: a high intensity, high commitment, long-term Partnership, on the one hand, and low-time-commitment, high-intimacy, companionship, on the other. </p>

	<h3>Long term</h3> <!--Intense partnership-->

	<p>In the long run, I’m looking for a <i>spiritual collaborator</i>, and for the other other half of an <i>altruistic power couple</i>.</p>
	<p>I want a relationship that is about helping each other become stronger and making the world better. We work together, train together,
		rest together, and make it easier for each other to live in integrity with our values, and generally face the world together. We help
		each other be badasses. <!--Not sure if I should include that last sentence.-->(Some more operationalization <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.) Needless to say, this is pretty intense kind of commitment.</p>

	<!--Note that I can talk about what I want in a _partner_ or talk about what I want in a _partnership_. and I should be carful about switching between those, because it makes the grammar weird.-->

<!-- <p>Ultimately, I’m looking for a sort of <i>spiritual collaboration</i>. A partnership with someone relentlessly and ambitiously dedicated to improving the world, who is striving to grow in skill and wisdom in order more effectively be a force for light
	in the universe, who will support me in doing the same. We work to make each other stronger. And we face the world together. (Some more operationalization <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ZikhCHkCsii2ecOAlZG4UO4o2xXVLz7DYIjebmE0K0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.)</p>
 -->


	<!--to face up to her own demons, -->

	<!--better live in integrity and-->

	<p>I want a partner who inspires me to be better than I am.</p>

	<!--<p>I have wanted something like this since I first booted up into a self-reflective, self-modifying loop at around 15.
	I think, that this is what I will ultimately want. However, currently I'm focusing on setting up my life and work to be stable without the support of
	a deep partnership. This is not the <em>main</em> thing I'm looking for at the moment, though I would be remiss not to at least mention this, in case a compatible person comes along.</p> -->

	<div>
	<p class="footnote">* - To be clear, I am an atheist. It is an extremely important fact about the universe (and about my worldview) that we are <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sYgv4eYH82JEsTD34/beyond-the-reach-of-god">beyond the reach of God</a>. But I am deeply concerned with matters of the spirit, no matter that souls turn out to be implemented by neurons.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Medium term</h3> <!--High intimacy, low commitment companionship-->

	<p><!--But that is a long term aim.-->However, I expect that it might take years for that hope to pan out. In the meantime, I’m looking for more companionship in my life.<!--: I would like to spend more time with women I like.-->

	<p>It would be great to have someone to hang out with about once or twice week: talking, circling a lot, co-working or strength training, being curious together, maybe cuddling, with a practiced expectation of
		being fully honest with each other.</p>

	<p>(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fyXcXT8yKdkxSxdkc1G4709NFBtfC6WVZym5rdbcS_s/edit?usp=sharing">This somewhat-out-of-date document</a>
		gives some ideas for what that could look like, given my focus on my work.)</p>

	<!--<p>In practice, this mostly entails hanging out a few times a week in the afternoon / early evening (in between my main work periods) to go on a walk or a hike, or coworking on tasks together in the evening to midnight. </p>-->

	<p>And, especially while I'm traveling, I'm glad to go on casual dates with anyone who thinks "sharing something one of us learned recently" or "trying to puzzle something out together" is a good first date, even if it doesn't seem likely to lead to any kind of long term relationship.</p>

	<!--<h4>What Dating Me Is Like</h4>-->

	<!-- <h4>Dates</h4>

	<p>Here are some activities that are my idea of a "good date". You don't have to be into all of these, just one of them.<p>

    <ul>
	<li>The uncomplicated default: We go on a walk (maybe into the hills, if we're in Berkeley) and talk, about life, about the world, about what we've each been pondering lately, about who and where we are and how we got there.</li>
	    <li>We meet up and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">Circle</a> together. If you're new to Circling, but interested, then we could do a similar, but more structured, Authentic Relating exercise, instead.</li>
    <!--<li> We try to make progress on some problem of yours. I listen, and try to help you solve it. Or, if there's something that you're trying to do or learn, and I try to help you get unstuck.</li> -->
    <!-- <li>We spend a half day trying to get a grip on something neither of us know anything about. (ie How do mitochondria work? How do you build a computer from logic gates? What's the deal with Modern Monetary Theory? How does the math of predictive processing work?) <!--A more extensive list of open questions is here--></li>
    <!-- <li>We go to some public place, like an airport, or a mall, or a zoo, and people-watch, comparing notes about what we observe and infer. Then we go and check our guesses<!--"check our guesses" should be a link to some page that I've written about the importance of feedback-->, by talking with those people.
	    <!--<li>We play around with some kind of new-to-us skill or modality (eg things like fermi estimates, or IFS, or vibe-reading, if any of those were new to me), and tinker to try and find functional-for-each-of-us versions.</li>-->

	    <!--<li>We make the world better somehow. When I was yonger, I had a policy of always going volunteering for first dates. But -->

	  <!-- </ul> -->

	    <!-- <p>If there's some other activity which seems good to do together, suggest it! I'm generally up for trying things other than psychoactive substances.</p> --> --> --> -->

	<h2>Constraints and deal-breakers</h2>

	<h3>Work</h3>

	<p>I am highly committed to my work. I think that the world is currently in a precarious state, moving in the direction of disaster, and that I personally stand any chance at all of doing something about that.</p>

	<p>As such, I work hard, and I spend the majority of my waking hours sequestered in my office.</p>

	<p>Anyone dating me in any recurring way will need to be ok with that, either because they have a similar orientation to the world themselves, or because they’re chill with a relationship that is intimate, without being time-intensive.</p>

	<h3>Honesty</h3>
	<p>The thing that is most important to me in all of my personal relationships is skilled honesty. </p>

	<p>I’ve sometimes been in contexts where there was something important that I felt like I “wasn’t allowed to say” for some reason or another. (Because it would offend someone, or because it “wasn’t my place”, or because pointing out some farce would make things worse, etc.)</p>

	<p>I’ve come to think that you can’t build anything robust on a foundation of this kind of holding back. I want to participate in contexts where I can be fully honest, and it is safe and practical for people to be fully honest with me, up to and including all of things that it is usually not polite or acceptable to say.</p>

	<p>Creating those kinds of contexts by main force isn't sustainable. It requires skill to say the things that can't usually be said, in a way that doesn't break everything.</p>

	<p>I make explicit, considered, effort, in all my important relationships, to build an API such that the two of us can say anything (including our judgements, frustrations, and deep feedback), in a way that the other party can hear it, without feeling attacked. And I’ve sought to develop the skills to support this kind of honesty, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Life-Changing-Relationships/dp/189200528X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=nonviolent+communication&qid=1627363910&sr=8-1">Nonviolent Communication</a>, <a href="https://rationality.org/">rationality</a>, <!--that last link should maybe be a link to one of my own conversational facilitation posts?-->and <a href="https://circlinginstitute.com/what-is-circling-method/">circling</a> skill.</p>

	<p>It is important to me that, between the two of us, we have enough skill to maintain this kind of connection: that it continues to feel possible, for you and for me, to share what’s up for us, even if that is uncomfortable or impolite or awkward.</p>
	</p>

	<!--<p>Maybe you do this in some very different way than I do, but familiarity with Circling and NVC, a developed introspective access, skills related to making space for / owning your triggers, and a basic "desire to relate to what's true", are all good signs.</p>-->


	<h3>Relationship style</h3>

	<p>I care about feeling secure in my relationship with my partner, and knowing that she values me in a stable more-or-less non-fungible way. Aside from that, I am glad for my partner to have other partners, short term or long term, if that lights her up.</p>

	<p>Personally, I’m pretty monogamous by nature, in that I don’t have much desire for more than one partner. (That said, my sense of how I relate to romance has shifted over the past few years, so maybe this will shift too.)</p>

	<h3>Kids</h3>

	<p>I’m not currently planning around having a family, but I would if I found a <i>highly</i> compatible partner and having kids was important to her.*</p>

		<p>That is to say, I am <em>open</em> to having kids, but only if we are an exceptionally good match.</p>

	<!--<p>I do have strong feelings about genomic selection: if I have kids at all, I am adamant about using whatever technologies are available at the time to increase their life-long health and intelligence.</p>-->

		<!--<h3>Height</h3>

		<p>I’m pretty short for an American man (around 5’4”), though I am fit and muscular.</p>

	<p>Insofar as height is something that my partner might care about, I’m sorry that I can't offer this. I would change it if I could, but tbe relevant biotechnology is not yet advanced enough (and probably won't be in the next 20 years).</p>-->

	<h3>Sex</h3>

	<p>Sex is not a priority for me. I would like to have sex with an intimate partner, but if she doesn't want that or can't, that's not a deal-breaker for me.</p>

	<h2>Some friends' descriptions of me:</h2>


<p>Friend 1: <em>"Erudite, stoic, and unrelentingly devoted to good. Also a little bit clumsy, but you can leave that part out.”</em></p>

<p>Friend 2: <em> "Human, on the lower end of height but upper percentage of brain capacity with a weird interest in saying true things, keeping commitments, and deliberately practicing skills he wants to get good at."</em></p>

<p>Friend 3: <em>“Eli is kind of what you would imagine a human might be like if you hadn't met any humans but had built a lot of houses.”</em></p>



	<h2>If you want to say hello...</h2>

	<p>If any of the above sounds interesting to you, or even if you just want to say hi, press <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe53HONWey-1sdJqYdUrjnaFezPidcF1TTROH4O2RgRCRHA6g/viewform?usp=sf_link" style="font-size: 20pt;"><b>this button</b></a> to tell me your name and a few sentences about you (or just email me <a href="elityre@gmail.com">here</a>). Maybe we can meet up the next time we're in the same metropolitan area.</p>

	<!--<p>If any of the above seems good to you, and you want to explore further, feel free to <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a> saying so. Or, if you don't know where to start, you can fill out

	<p>I'm grateful to everyone who takes initiative and reaches out, even if it turns out we're not a good match. In <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/timeless-decision-theory">an important way</a>, your doing that is the only reason this system works at all. So thank you. : ) </p>

	<p>If you would like more detail about who I am, or what I care about,<!--you might explore the rest of this site, starting with the <a>about page</a>--> <a href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/6765423466650624251">this</a> is an old okcupid profile of mine.

	<h2>Aid my quest!</h2>

<p>If you’re not a good match with me (you’re male, or married, or want something different than I do), but you'd like this project to succeed, there are two things you can do help: </p>

<p>First, and most crucially, you can help by connecting me with thoughtful, single (and/or poly) women who want the sort of thing that I want <!-- / you think might want to date me-->. If you took even 5 minutes right now to flip through your facebook friends and consider if any of them might want to date someone like me, you will earn my <a href="bounties.html">gratitude</a><!--, and, hopefuly, that of the other party as well-->.

<!--<p>Secondly, you can give me feedback on this page. I've benefited enormously from hearing people's unfiltered reactions to the text here, so that I can iterate to a version that communicates what is important, without cruft. If you're interested in giving me line by line comments of how this lands for you, especially if you're a woman who shares many of my values, I would greatly appreciate it. However, please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me
to tell me that you're interested, instead of just sending me your reactions, since it is less helpful to get feedback while I'm in the revision stage and still incorporating the feedback from the last round.</p>-->

<!--
	<h3>What sort of person am I looking for?</h3>
,
<p>This section is all the way down here, at the bottom of the page, because it’s mostly not relevant for people reading to see if they if they might want to go on a date with me. If they feel excited by the sort of interactions that I describe, I don’t want to discourage them because they don’t embody the traits I outline here.</p>

<p>However, for third parties who are hoping to help play match-maker, the above is a bit...abstract.</p>

<p>So the following are some more concrete traits, that empirically, in my life so far, have been predictive of people that I have liked and/or loved. These are not “standards”, in the sense of characteristics that I insist on in a partner, but rather characteristics or traits that are shared by many of the women I most like spending time with.</p>

<p>If you happen to know someone who is well described by the following, you might be doing us both a favor by, introing us, or sending her a link to this page.</p>

	<h4>Empirical predictors of the kinds of people Eli wants to date</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Female, in roughly my age range.</li>
	<li>Unusually ethical. Committed to making the world right, or fair, or good, or much better than it currently is.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The sort of person who, at some point in her life, thought that / planned to give away most of her income to charity.</li>

		<li>Probably vegan or vegetarian.</li>

		</ul>

	<li>Works a lot. Is the sort of person who might be described as a workaholic. </li>

	<li>Thoughtful, and puts her thought into practice. [Can I elaborate this? Exmaples would be helpful.</li>

	<li>Intelligent.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>In particular, possessing impressive verbal fluency. She's self assured and fast on her feet in conversation. </li>

		</ul>

	<li>Might be described as conventionally "pretty". (I feel a bit embarrased about including this, because it seems like a sad fact about the world that people's non-consensual physicality limits the romantic relationships that they enjoy, but nevertheless, it does seems to be a predictor.)</li>

	<li>Curious about the world.</li>

	<li>An atheist, but also has what might be described as a “spiritual practice” (meditation, introspection, ritual, gratitude practice, a reverence for the sacred, a focus on intentionality, etc.).</li>

	<li>Of Jewish ancestry.</li>

	<li>Doesn't drink (alcohol).</li>

	<li>[Both "having good style" and "visibly prioritizing comfort and practicatlity over appearance" have been predictors.]</li>

	<li>Affable and sociable, though not necessarily extroverted per se. Generally happy.</li>

	</ul>

	<p>To everyone who spends a little bit of time playing match maker, thank you. : )</p>
