		<h1>Orthogonal Content</h1>

	<h2>My favorite orthogonal content</h2>
	<p>
		Many of the things I think are most useful or insightful or helpful for me to have read are from the broader rationality and effective altruism communities - posts on Slate Star Codex, LessWrong essays, EA Forum posts, et cetera. (Or, on the recreational side, works of <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/">rational fiction</a> or <a href="https://www.projectlawful.com/posts/6322">glowfic</a>.)
	</p>

	<p>
		If you aren't familiar with this particular sphere of the interest, I highly recommend it! Ignore this post and read the Sequences, or <a href = "https://slatestarcodex.com/top-posts/">the top posts of SSC</a>, or <a href="https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/1">HPMOR</a>, or <a href = "https://gwern.net/About">other</a> <a href = "https://blog.jaibot.com/500-million-but-not-a-single-one-more/">classic</a> <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/">blog</a> posts.
	</p>
	<p>
		But I expect that many readers of this page will already be swimming in more than enough such content. As such, I'm using this page to make a list of everything I quite like that seems relatively unknown within my ingroup - the things with the largest residuals after I subtract out the primary PCA component of "rationalist-adjacent".
	</p>
	<p>
		In the interests of keeping this list short, I've applied a fairly high bar or restricted to things that I think a good fraction of people would enjoy. (As of February 2023, this list is bottlenecked not on my discovery of interesting content but on my getting around to putting more items in it.)

			Terence Tao <a href ="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/">on the "post-rigorous" stage of mathematics</a>

			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9_p50tH3WmMslWRWKnM7dQ">Adam Ragusea</a> creates one of my favorite cooking channels on youtube: cares about directness and optimizing for the values of real people cooking and doing empiricism.
		</li>
		<li>
			CS Lewis: <a href="https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/">The Inner Ring</a>. Fairly well known, but worth a reread IMO even if you've seen it before.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://zesty.ca/voting/sim/">Voting simulation visualizations</a> by Ka-Ping Yee and an <a href="http://zesty.ca/voting/voteline/">interactive one-dimensional visualization</a>. I found this really informative, and it updated me away from IRV/Hare/RCV as a voting system. See also <a href="https://rangevoting.org/IEVS/Pictures.html">these graphs</a> from rangevoting.org that explore even more scenarios with the same methodology and consider some interesting cases like candidate cloning, though as indicated by the URL the source comes at things with a bias.
